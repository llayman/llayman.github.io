### Research Opportunities
I am seeking undergraduate and graduate researchers for multiple research projects beginning in Spring 2024. Please reach out if interested.

<!-- ##### 1. Visual Assistant for Git in VSCode
The learning curve for proper git usage is steep, but a visual representation of git state and next steps can help. 
- Conduct research with students on difficulties in learning the git platform.
- Implement a Visual Studio Code plugin to visualize the state of git repos and provide recommendations.
- **Requirements**: minimum 3.2 GPA and junior or higher standing, strong programming skills. Experience with JavaScript preferred.
- [I'm interested!](mailto:laymanl@uncw.edu?subject=Visual Assistant for Git) -->

##### 1. Coastal Eco Explorer Mobile App Development
The [Coastal Esco Explorer](https://uncw.edu/academics/colleges/wce/partnerships-centers/coastal-eco-explorer/) ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.uncwrf.coastalecoexplorer&hl=en_US&gl=US), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/coastal-eco-explorer/id1500638322)) is UNCW's first homegrown app. It is a cross-platform mobile application that delivers educational information about Carolina Beach State Park and Fort Fisher State Recreation Area.
- Contribute to a published, downloaded piece of software and learn about app publishing.
- Implement best software development practices.
- **Requirements**: Experience one mobile application development language required; Flutter experience preferred. Strong object-oriented programming skills are a must.
- [I'm interested!](mailto:laymanl@uncw.edu?subject=Coastal Eco Explorer)

##### 2. Trust in AI-Assisted Coding
LLMs like ChatGPT can generate code, but should we trust the results or sharing our data?
- Systematically identify the limits of code-generation LLMs in software coding and testing tasks.
- Conduct studies with programmers to discover LLM usage patterns and limitations.
- **Requirements**: minimum 3.2 GPA and junior or higher standing, strong Python skills 
- [I'm interested!](mailto:laymanl@uncw.edu?subject=Trust in AI-Assisted Coding)

##### 3. Performance Impact of Cybersecurity Tool UI Design
How does the design (color, audio, interruption) of cybersecurity alarm system UIs impact analyst performance?
- Conduct studies of humans performing a cybersecurity task and capture their physiological outputs, including eye tracking and GSR.
- **Requirements**: minimum 3.2 GPA and junior or higher standing, strong programming skills, experience in JavaScript or React/Electron development.
- [I'm interested!](mailto:laymanl@uncw.edu?subject=Impact of Cyber UI Design)


##### 4. Novel Authentication Library for Android and iOS
Passwords are tedious and tokens can be stolen. This project will work with an external sponsor to implement an existing patent.
- Write a mobile application library and web server backend that provides novel, gesture- and memory-based authentication.
- **Requirements**: graduate student with undergraduate computer science degree and familiarity with Android, iOS, or cross-platform development tools.
